Hello!

This is an example of 3 decently tricky methods methods I had to impliment for a Pitt Computer Science course, Data Structures and Algarithims 1. 

Add() -- This added two provided integers
Subtract() -- This subtracts one integers from another
multiply() -- This multiplys two provided integers togther. 

Both Test files are examples of these methods in action!

I am very proud of my solutions here as they took many long nights and hours to fully think through and impliment correctly.
